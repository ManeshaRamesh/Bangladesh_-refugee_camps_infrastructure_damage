						<p class = "summary">This dataset holds information about the facilities in the refugee settlement of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. In particular, it provides information regarding the Natural Disaster Risk of each of the facilities avilable in the settlement in this ongoing monsoon. This dataset was obtained from the Humanitarian Data Exchange which is administered by The United Nations.This information can help local as well as international resetllment aid groups in Bangladesh easily plan out their target areas and populations. By hosting this information on a website and providing relevant filters, these aid groups could easily categorize their target groups, areas and facilities. The website displays the Unique Id for each facility (important for aid groups to know which facility exactly among the many), the type of facility, the name of the camp it is located in, the source of funding and whether it is threatened by any natural disasters. For example, if the user wishes to search for Mosques that are at risk of getting damaged, the appropriate filters can be used to obtain the desired results. Some user-friendly sorting options are provided as well. </p>
